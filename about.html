      <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> About Homecoming</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Homecoming is not affiliated with any organization</strong>, not connected to any official company, and never sells any content or software. It is a free clan where players play purely for fun and entertainment. <strong>HCLauncheR</strong> was created by <em>SNIPER</em>, who also made Homecoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name <strong>Homecoming</strong> signifies soldiers returning home after a war and praying for the souls of those who were lost. Its origin comes from the IGI2 server, which fought against multiple servers and became the number one community due to the passion of its players.
      </p>

      <p>
        IGI-2 Homecoming was established by <strong>SNIPER</strong>, in partnership with <strong>Ghost, Shooter, and Nikku</strong> (short: GSSN).

     About CONTENT 
============================= -->
  <section class="about-text">
  <h2>The Heart of IGI-2 Multiplayer Community</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Homecoming Gaming</strong> is a global community built around the legendary tactical shooter 
    <em>Project I.G.I-2: Covert Strike</em>. It is an independent initiative created by dedicated fans to 
    preserve and expand IGI-2’s multiplayer experience. Our team develops and maintains free tools such as 
    <strong>HCLauncheR</strong>, <strong>HcCommanDeR</strong>, and <strong>HcBan</strong>, designed to help players 
    host, manage, and secure their IGI2 servers with ease. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Homecoming Project</strong> began with the vision of bringing players together after the 
    official multiplayer servers became inactive. Inspired by teamwork, nostalgia, and a love for fair play, 
    we created a network where players could once again compete, communicate, and relive the golden era of IGI-2. 
    Our tools focus on performance, reliability, and simplicity — allowing even beginners to host 
    professional-grade multiplayer sessions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>HCLauncheR</strong> serves as the entry point for players, providing one-click access to verified servers, 
    automatic version management, and quick mod installation. 
    <strong>HcCommanDeR</strong> acts as the control center for server administrators, offering real-time RCON access, 
    player monitoring, and live logs for chat, kills, and commands. 
    Meanwhile, <strong>HcBan</strong> ensures that every server stays safe from crashers, packet flooders, 
    and other disruptive activity by automatically detecting and banning suspicious connections.
  </p>

  <p>
    At its core, <strong>Homecoming Gaming</strong> represents the spirit of the IGI-2 community — 
    teamwork, respect, and nostalgia. We believe that the game’s tactical depth and realistic stealth gameplay 
    still have a place in modern multiplayer culture. Every player who joins Homecoming contributes to keeping 
    this classic game alive for the next generation of fans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is simple: to support the <strong>IGI2 player base</strong> with modern, secure, and free tools 
    that enhance gameplay without changing what makes the game special. We do not sell, promote, or monetize 
    any content; everything we offer is made freely for the community. 
    <strong>Homecoming Gaming</strong> stands as a tribute to those who have been part of IGI since the beginning — 
    soldiers, snipers, and strategists who continue to keep the battlefield alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Join us today on Discord, Facebook, or YouTube to connect with fellow players, get updates on our latest 
    projects, and experience the true legacy of <strong>Project IGI-2</strong> with 
    <strong>Homecoming Gaming</strong>.
